# 1:  Karl Popper

## a.  Two kinds of philosophy of science

Two quite distinct enterprises have been carried out under the name of "philosophy of science": **philosophy of scientific theories** (**PST**), which deals with what scientists say and believe, and **philosophy of scientific research** (**PSR**), which deals with what scientists do.  Until the 1960s, philosophy of science consisted mainly of philosophy of scientific theories and thus was concerned with questions such as:

* What constitutes a scientific theory?
* How can one evaluate scientific theories?  e.g. can one speak of a theory as being true or false, and if so, what entitles one to say that a theory is true or to say that it is false?
* Under what circumstances is one justified in rejecting one theory in favor of another or in preferring one theory over another?

These questions have very little to do with the persons that are engaged in scientific research: they refer to justification for drawing various conclusions, but they don't refer to anything that human beings would do other than accept or reject theories (e.g. they don't say anything about how one might come up with a theory in the first place), nor do they say anything about the communities within which scientific research is done.  The science that they allude to could just as well be "Robinson Crusoe science": science done by a single isolated person who carried out some sort of scientific research and reaches whatever conclusions he does without regard to any contact that he might have with other researchers.[^1]

Philosophy of scientific research (PSR), by contrast, deals with questions that in many cases crucially involve scientific communities.  For example Kuhn's notions of "paradigm", "normal science", and "revolution" make sense only when discussed in terms of scientific communities; a Robinson Crusoe scientist can have a scientific epiphany, but he can't have a scientific revolution.  Some questions that one might ask in the course of doing PSR are:

* What constitutes "success" in an episode of scientific research?  What constitutes "failure"?
* What are the possible responses to "failure", and what justifies the choice of a particular response?  (cf. Lakatos on counterexamples)
* What constitutes a scientific community?
* How is scientific research influenced by the scientific community within which it is done?
* How do scientific communities reach a consensus about results that particular scientists may claim to have established?

## b.  Critical rationalism I: criticism

Sir Karl Popper (1904 [sic] - 1994) worked more in PST than in PSR, but his work includes occasional digressions into PSR that are of considerable interest.  Popper's approach to philosophy of science is generally known as **critical rationalism**.  The words "critical" and "rationalism" refer to two different aspects of his view of science.  The present section is devoted to the parts of Popper's philosophy that are associated with the first of these words; his "rationalism" will be taken up in detail in ยง1.4.

"Critical" refers to the general notion of **criticism**, of which **falsification** is a special case.  For Popper, progress in science (or anything?) comes about through criticism of existing ideas, i.e. by subjecting ideas to tests and seeing how well they fare, with the option of revising or rejecting them if they don't fare well enough.  He often uses the expression "trial and error", alluding to episodes involving "tests", and revision/rejection in response to the outcomes of such tests.  Falsification is the species of criticism in which one determines implications of a **theory** as to what the facts should be and determines whether the facts conform to those implications; if the implications conflict with the facts, the discrepancy between facts and implications **falsifies** the theory.  The more general notion of criticism allows for a theory to fail tests of other kinds, as when one rejects a theory on the grounds that it commits one to "undesirable" entities.  (This idea is developed later by Laudan, who develops a notion scientific "problems" takes in not only "empirical problems" but also "conceptual problems"; see chapter โข.)

# NOTES

[^1]. The term "Robinson Crusoe science" is modeled after "Robinson Crusoe economics", which is the area of economics dealing with how a single individual might deploy resources that he has at his disposal, ignoring any transactions that he might carry out with other persons.

Popper's approach deals largely with "Robinson Crusoe science".  He does talk about "traditions" in "Towards a rational theory of tradition", but his concern there is mainly with the lore of existing communities as providing ideas that can be developed into theories that a Robinson Crusoe scientist can test.  When he talks about competing theories, it is immaterial whether the theories each have their own adherents or whether a single scientist is simply choosing among alternatives.
