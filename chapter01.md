## a.  Two kinds of philosophy of science

Two quite distinct enterprises have been carried out under the name of "philosophy of science": **philosophy of scientific theories** (**PST**), which deals with what scientists say and believe, and **philosophy of scientific research** (**PSR**), which deals with what scientists do.  Until the 1960s, philosophy of science consisted mainly of philosophy of scientific theories and thus was concerned with questions such as:

* What constitutes a scientific theory?
* How can one evaluate scientific theories?  e.g. can one speak of a theory as being true or false, and if so, what entitles one to say that a theory is true or to say that it is false?
* Under what circumstances is one justified in rejecting one theory in favor of another or in preferring one theory over another?

These questions have very little to do with the persons that are engaged in scientific research: they refer to justification for drawing various conclusions, but they don't refer to anything that human beings would do other than accept or reject theories (e.g. they don't say anything about how one might come up with a theory in the first place), nor do they say anything about the communities within which scientific research is done.  The science that they allude to could just as well be "Robinson Crusoe science": science done by a single isolated person who carried out some sort of scientific research and reaches whatever conclusions he does without regard to any contact that he might have with other researchers.[1]

Philosophy of scientific research (PSR), by contrast, deals with questions that in many cases crucially involve scientific communities.  For example Kuhn's notions of "paradigm", "normal science", and "revolution" make sense only when discussed in terms of scientific communities; a Robinson Crusoe scientist can have a scientific epiphany, but he can't have a scientific revolution.  Some questions that one might ask in the course of doing PSR are:
